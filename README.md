# Meltdown

A simple to code and use Markup language making much use of brackets.

The key point is to bracket the text that is to be formatted.

**This is a work in progress at the moment.**

## Updates

1.  **Now a second version of the class that formalises the functionality making
    it easy to change the delimeters used. See the V2 of the class. Also key
    steps (font color and links) are a separate functions. Uses the second
    schema below**

2.  Some bug fixes completed. Test app has some test strings.

3.  Implemented headings. eg, `[[2]]At start of line` becomes `<h2>At start of
    Line</h2>`

## Context

When implementing SendMail functionality with C\# code, for example in a Blazor
app, you can send unformatted text or text formatted with HTML tags. HTML tags
are though not simple for a luddite. Alternatively, one could provide a Markdown
parser to generate HTML tags. Meltdown is meant to be a simple to implement
markup as a parser that outputs HTML, that makes much use of brackets.

## The Acid Tests

1.  Can the markdown syntax be implemented in, say, C\#, by a 102 level student?

2.  Is the formatting easier than Markdown to use by a non-programmer?

## Specification

The generated content is HTML so

-   The source content is in the main Text.

-   HTML can be seamlessly embedded in a page, and so is unmodified by the
    parser.

-   Certain start and end bracket sequences HTML format the internal text by
    replacing the brackets with the required HTML begin and end tags.

-   The brackets are used in pairs so that a sequence consisting of an open
    bracket, close bracket and text in between is unchanged.

-   Open brackets are a pair of [ ( and {

-   The corresponding close brackets are a mirroring pair of } ) and ]

-   For example: [[Hello there]] will translate to \<b\>Hello there\</b\>

-   Where a parameter is required, or the sequence is in two parts a \| is used
    as a separator.

-   Use of \< .. \> in the syntax is avoided as these are the basis of HTML
    tags.

-   Formatting tags can be combined with inner text of a Meltdown tag conforming
    to another tag. But 3 and 4 bracketing tags are defined explicitly for often
    some combinations.

-   Desirable: Text can be written in Word and with simple modification be used
    with a copy a paste as Meltdown.

**Nb 1:** Bold, italics and underline formats all start with [ , bold takes
precedence for combinations and italics takes precedence over underline. For
example, Bold-Italics starts with the open square bracket, then the bold second
character, followed by the Italics second character [-[-(  
*If these specifications are adopted then the notes in the third column are
defunct.*

**Nb 2:** Markdown syntax has also been implemented: [](*%3curl%3e*)

*An alternative specification under consideration is:*

## Conclusion

So which of the the 2 schemas above is simpler to implement and at the same time
more intuitive for a novice to use?

Nb: Some C\# code to follow soon: **Update** A first version is now available.
